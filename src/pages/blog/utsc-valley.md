# Introduction
Ever since we were young, we have always been told to eat healthy foods, like fruits and vegetables, and avoid eating junk food. Canada’s Food Guide has become a well-known resource amongst parents and schools, advocating about the benefits of eating fresh produce on healthy child development. Even as we were growing up, we were constantly reminded that eating potato chips does not satisfy our recommended  daily vegetable intake - you can never escape the message of healthy eating! As healthy nutrition is frequently mentioned, wherever we are, it is important to understand the benefits of eating fruits, vegetables, and nuts on physical and mental health. 

Although older teens and adults don’t often think about their eating habits as having a positive impact on their physical and mental wellbeing, it seems the myth about not benefitting from eating healthy once you pass the stage of childhood is debunked - it is very possible that we can strengthen our brain power even after childhood. Here is a breakdown of some of the health benefits of eating delicious fruits, vegetables, and nuts:

# Fruits and Veggies
There has been considerable research on the health effects of eating fruits and vegetables in adults and children. Studies have shown that eating fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e., disease that affects the heart and blood vessels) as well as cancer (Aune et al. 2017). There is also evidence suggesting that eating berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, may prevent neurodegeneration that is associated with aging, specifically in areas of cognition and motor function (Miller and Shukitt-Hale 2012). Furthermore, in animal models, it was found that eating berries seems to enhance the brain’s ability to modify its connections or rewire itself - reducing the impact of natural cognitive decline that comes with age (Miller and Shukitt-Hale 2012). For humans, this may potentially be correlated with better memory and cognition with age compared to people who are not eating berry fruits as often. This suggests that the positive health impacts of eating berries is not only limited to young children, but also greatly benefits adults and the elderly, even if they  add these foods to their diets when they are older. 

# Go Nuts!
The most common types of nuts consumed today include almonds, walnuts, pecans, and pistachios. With regards to walnuts, research has shown that increased consumption has been linked to a decrease in risk of cardiovascular disease - which includes stroke, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and heart disease (Kris-Etherton 2008; Chauhan and Chauhan 2020). This is because nuts are great sources of dietary fiber and protein, and may reduce low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol (Ros 2015). LDL cholesterol is often called “bad” cholesterol as high levels of this can  increase one’s risk of heart disease and stroke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2020). Incorporating nuts into our diet seems to be a fast-pass to better brain and heart health, and is one of the easiest dietary changes we can make (Arslan et al. 2020). Even a small handful of nuts a day can make a big impact on a person’s health in the future. In addition, walnuts also contain antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Studies on animals and humans showed that diets which included walnuts seemed to decrease one’s risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression (Chauhan and Chauhan 2020). In their study, they used aAD mouse model and discovered that those who ate walnuts were associated with greater benefits to memory, anxiety and learning compared. Similar findings were found in human trials, where cognition and memory improved overtime on walnut supplemented diets as compared to adults who did not consume walnuts.

As there is considerable research on the topic of healthy foods improving  health, it makes sense to encourage young university students to engage in better eating habits, specifically to consume more berries and nuts to increase brain health. Not only is eating healthy good for you physically, but it can also boost your mood and make you happier (Selhub 2015). Your brain would appreciate getting some real food once in a while to keep it going (sorry, ramen isn’t going to cut it). University students spend long hours memorizing facts and learning new material, and any boost to memory would definitely be appreciated. A decreased risk of neurodegeneration is also an added bonus!

# Conclusion

University of Toronto Scarborough, recognizing this need, developed the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) Valley with plans to add berries and nuts along the trail as part of a “healthy campus” initiative (Ngabo 2020). However, this project is just one part of the Edible Campus Initiative and will be the first of its kind in Toronto when complete. The Toronto star writes that Daniel Bender, who is the director of culinary research centre at UTSC, envisions that this new train will inspire other universities and cities to do the same on their campuses (Ngabo 2020). As there is considerable research suggesting the benefits of fruits and nuts on physical and mental health, UTSC students can find solace in knowing their university has their brain health in mind. UTSC is not just an academic institution looking to educate future scholars; they have also considered  expanding the minds of their students by fueling their  brains with healthy goodness through incorporating fruits and nuts along the Valley - which studies suggest may increase memory and decrease risk of neurodegeneration. It seems my parents were right - I need to eat more almonds! For now, the Valley plans to have cherries, strawberries, black walnuts, and black cherries. I sure hope I can get my hands on some of them in the future!
