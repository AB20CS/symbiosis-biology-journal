# Introduction
A whopping 20-60% of patients experience **long COVID** after having a SARS-CoV-2 infection (Novak et al., 2021). SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19, an **acute** disease, meaning it lasts for a short period (days to weeks) (Novak et al., 2021; Brutto et al., 2021; CDC, 2022). However, there are symptoms that can occur beyond this period of time, known as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, or long COVID (Novak et al., 2021; Brutto et al., 2021). This can manifest differently for everyone, including fatigue, **dyspnea** and **brain fog** (Novak et al., 2021). Here, the link between COVID-19 and brain fog, specifically on its **epidemiology**, risk factors, mechanism, and how it can be prevented will be a central focus. Brain fog occurs when patients who have COVID-19 experience issues with memory, multitasking and sleeping disorders (Sklinda et al, 2021). This is an important concept as brain fog is an example of psychiatric and neurological problems, which can manifest in approximately one-third of those who survive the COVID-19 disease (Sklinda et al., 2021). 


# Overview of Brain Fog 
COVID-19 symptoms can last anywhere from four to twelve weeks, while long COVID can occur after twelve weeks (Callan et al., 2022). Symptoms of brain fog can look different for everyone. Some common ones are issues with **executive function**, attention, memory, and language (Callan et al., 2022). Lowered maximum **grip strength** and **gait speeds** are some examples of these issues (Asadi-pooya et al., 2022). In a cohort study of 2696 people, it was estimated that of those aged 18-55 who contracted COVID-19 and were hospitalized, 7.2% developed brain fog (Asadi-Pooya et al., 2022). Among long COVID patients with neurological symptoms, brain fog is present in 81% of cases (Mathern et al., 2022). It was noted that brain fog was more likely to be present if a patient was female, had respiratory problems the infection started, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission was necessary (Asadi-Pooya et al., 2022). It can occur even in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 (Brutto et al., 2021). **Cognitive decline** was shown to improve over time, twelve months post-COVID-19 infection (Brutto et al., 2021). However, there are currently limited studies on the prognosis of cognitive decline, so it cannot be determined with certainty (Brutto et al., 2021).
